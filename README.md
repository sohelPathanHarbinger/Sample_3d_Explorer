# 3D Tour Template

> **Maintaining or extending it?** See **[DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md)**: every setting, recipes for common changes, environment types, the coordinate picker and troubleshooting.

A reusable **3D walkthrough** for the browser, built with plain **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**, with no build step and no npm.

Visitors are driven through an environment stop by stop, or walk around freely with the keyboard. Glowing markers open popups that can show a **header**, **text**, an **image**, **audio** and **video** (a file or YouTube/Vimeo link), in any combination.

The environment can be **built in code**, loaded from a **3D model** (.glb/.gltf), or made from **360° photos**. The type is detected automatically.

The code is split into:
- **the engine**, which is shared by every project and never edited for one, and
- **projects**, one folder each (for example a Harbinger office or a bank branch), holding everything that makes a tour unique.

## How to run

The page uses JavaScript modules, which browsers only load from a web server. Double-clicking `index.html` will **not** work. Use one of these options:

| Option | How | Address |
|---|---|---|
| **VS Code (easiest)** | Install the **Live Server** extension, right-click `index.html`, choose **Open with Live Server** | http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html |
| Python | `python -m http.server 8080` in this folder | http://localhost:8080/index.html |
| Node | `npx serve .` in this folder | the URL it prints |

You need an internet connection, because Three.js loads from a CDN (see "Working offline" below).

### Running another project (for example the starter)

Every project lives in `projects/<folder>`. To open one:

- **For one visit:** add `?project=<folder>` to the address, for example:
  - http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html?project=starter (Live Server)
  - http://localhost:8080/index.html?project=starter (Python)
- **As the default:** set `ACTIVE_PROJECT = 'starter'` at the top of `engine/config.js`.

### Controls
- **Arrow keys** (plus the letter keys in `walk.keys`, W A S D by default) walk forward, back and sideways in the direction you are looking. Walls and furniture block the way.
- **Move the mouse** to look around. With `look.mouseFollow: 'turn'` (default), the view keeps turning while the mouse is towards the left or right side. With `'lean'` it leans a little towards the mouse. Turning pauses while the mouse is on a marker.
- **Drag** to look around (including up and down). By default, mouse dragging is off while mouse-follow is on, and on when `mouseFollow: 'off'`. Change this with `look.drag`. On touch screens dragging always works.
- **Mouse speed** is set by `look.sensitivity` (0.5 = half as fast, 2 = twice as fast).
- **Click** a marker to open its popup. Markers glow when you are near them, otherwise they show as a plain icon.
- **◀ / ▶ buttons** move to the previous or next stop. After walking around freely, they fade and jump instead of driving.
- **Dots** jump straight to any stop.
- **▾ / ▴** collapses or expands the bottom panel.
- **Auto** moves on by itself every few seconds.
- **Esc** closes a popup.

The on-screen help always describes the current keys and mouse settings.

### Address options
| Add to the address | What it does |
|---|---|
| `?project=starter` | show another project |
| `?stop=5` | open directly at stop 5 |
| `?stop=2&hotspot=reception-desk` | also open that marker's popup |
| `?pick` | turn on the **coordinate picker** (see below) |

Combine them with `&`, for example `index.html?project=starter&stop=2&pick`.

## What is configurable, and where

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Company name, tagline, browser-tab title, favicon, small logo | `projects/<name>/project-config.js` |
| Start-screen texts (kicker, title, paragraph) | `project-config.js` → `intro` |
| Brand colours for the on-screen interface **and** the 3D world | `project-config.js` → `theme` |
| Environment type: code, 3D model or 360° photo | `project-config.js` → `environment` (see below) |
| Camera, tour speed, Auto delay, mouse sensitivity, mouse-follow, dragging, walking speed/keys, marker size/glow, shadows… | Defaults and documentation in `engine/config.js`; override in `project-config.js` → `settings` |
| Tour stops, camera positions, markers, popup text/image/audio/video | `projects/<name>/tour-data.js` |
| The code-built 3D world: rooms, walls, furniture | `projects/<name>/environment.js` |
| Project-only data such as leader names or room names | Anything extra in `project-config.js`, imported by your own `environment.js` and `tour-data.js` |

Example of overriding engine settings for one project:

```js
settings: {
  look: { mouseFollow: 'off', sensitivity: 1.5 },   // drag only, a bit faster
  walk: { speed: 3 },
  graphics: { shadows: false },
  camera: { introPosition: [0, 8, 40], introLookAt: [0, 2, 0] },
}
```

---

## Environment types (detected automatically)

The `environment` line in `project-config.js` decides how the world is made:

| In `project-config.js` | Type | What you provide |
|---|---|---|
| *(no `environment` line)* | **Code** | `environment.js`, built with the kit (like the Harbinger office and the starter) |
| `environment: 'assets/models/bank.glb'` | **3D model** | a `.glb` or `.gltf` file from Blender, SketchUp, 3ds Max, Revit… |
| `environment: 'assets/360/lobby.jpg'` | **360° photo** | 2:1 panorama photos (`.jpg` `.png` `.webp`) from a 360° camera or phone app |

The type is taken from the file extension. Options can be given as an object, for example `environment: { file: 'assets/models/bank.glb', scale: 0.01, rotationDeg: 90 }`, and `type: 'model'` or `type: 'panorama'` can be written out if the extension is unusual.

### 3D model
- Model in **metres**, with y = up and the floor where visitors walk. Use `scale: 0.01` for a model made in centimetres. `position` and `rotationDeg` move and turn it.
- **Walking collision is automatic:** every separate object that stands on the floor and is taller than 30 cm blocks the way. Floors, ceilings, lights and very large combined objects are ignored.
  - Name an object `…nocollide…` to let visitors walk through it.
  - Name one `…collider…` to make it an invisible wall.
  - It works best when walls and furniture are separate objects in the model.
- The start-screen view is chosen automatically, looking at the model from the front. Set `settings.camera.introPosition` to choose your own.
- `collision: false` turns walking collision off.

### 360° photos
- The visitor stands in the middle of the photo and looks around. There is no keyboard walking, and moving to another stop fades to that stop's photo.
- Give each stop its own photo in `tour-data.js`: `panorama: 'assets/360/reception.jpg'`, and `camera: { position: [0, 0, 0], lookAt: [0, 0, -1] }`.
- The **middle of each photo faces forward** (`lookAt: [0, 0, -1]`). Use `rotationDeg` in `environment` to turn all photos.
- Only the current stop's markers are shown. Place them with the coordinate picker.
- Tip: for photo tours, `settings: { look: { mouseFollow: 'off' } }` gives classic drag-to-look, including looking up and down.

---

## Coordinate picker

A tool for building tours, turned on by adding `?pick` to the address, for example `index.html?pick` or `index.html?project=starter&pick`. Visitors never see it.

1. Drive or walk to the area you are working on.
2. **Click any spot** (a floor, a wall, a desk, or a point on a 360° photo). The panel shows, and copies to the clipboard:
   - **Marker:** `position: [x, y, z],`, placed 0.3 m in front of the clicked surface, ready to paste into a hotspot in `tour-data.js`.
   - **Floor x, z:** for `place(parent, object, x, z)` in `environment.js`.
3. **Stop camera** always shows where you are standing and looking right now, for example `camera: { position: [0, EYE, -1.8], lookAt: […] },`. Press its **Copy** button and paste it into a stop.

A small pin marks the last clicked spot. Clicking a marker still opens its popup. The values are also printed in the browser console (F12).

---

## Creating a new project (for example a bank branch)

1. **Copy** `projects/starter` (or `projects/harbinger-office`) to `projects/bank-branch`.
2. **Show it:** open `index.html?project=bank-branch`. To make it the default, set `ACTIVE_PROJECT = 'bank-branch'` in `engine/config.js`.
3. **Branding:** edit `project-config.js`, which sets the name, tagline, intro texts, `theme` colours, `logoMark` and `favicon`.
4. **Choose the environment:**
   - **Code:** build it in `environment.js` with the kit (see below).
   - **3D model:** put the model in `assets/models/`, set `environment: 'assets/models/bank.glb'` and delete `environment.js`.
   - **360° photos:** put them in `assets/360/`, set `environment: 'assets/360/entrance.jpg'` and delete `environment.js`.
5. **Add the tour** in `tour-data.js`: stops, markers and popups. Use `?pick` to get the coordinates.
6. **Add media** to `projects/bank-branch/assets/` and refer to it as `'assets/images/…'`.

You don't need to change anything in `engine/`, `index.html` (apart from the default project) or `css/`.

**Bank props already in the kit (code-built):** walls, glass walls, automatic doors, the fingerprint scanner, signs, screens (for example a token display), sofas, chairs, the executive desk, the conference table, the reception desk, plants, the pantry set, trees and lamp posts.

**Props you would add:** a teller counter, an ATM, queue barriers and a vault door. Write them as `createXxx()` functions in `projects/bank-branch/props.js`, in the style of `engine/kit/furniture.js`.

## Building an environment in code (the kit)

A code-built environment's `environment.js` exports one function that the engine calls:

```js
import { FACE, startWorld, finishWorld, addLights, place, addFloor, buildWall,
         addWindow, addProximityDoors, blockWalking, onEveryFrame } from '../../engine/kit/building.js';
import * as F from '../../engine/kit/furniture.js';
import { MAT } from '../../engine/kit/materials.js';

export function buildEnvironment(scene) {
  const world = startWorld(scene, { wallHeight: 3.2 });           // 1. start
  addLights(scene, { center: [0, 0, -5], size: 20 });            //    sun + sky light, shadows over ±20 m
  const g = world.group;

  addFloor(g, -6, -10, 6, 0, MAT.floorWood);                     // 2. build: floor from (x1,z1) to (x2,z2)
  buildWall(g, { axis: 'x', at: 0, from: -6, to: 6, doors: [{ center: 0, width: 2 }] });
  addProximityDoors(g, { x: 0, z: 0, leafWidth: 1, height: 2.4, triggerRadius: 4 });
  place(g, F.createPlant(), 4, -2);                              //    place(parent, object, x, z, facing, y)
  place(g, F.createSofa(2.2), -5.3, -3, FACE.right);

  return finishWorld({ bounds: { minX: -20, maxX: 20, minZ: -15, maxZ: 20 } }); // 3. finish
}
```

- **Coordinates** are in metres. Looking from the entrance into the building, **x** runs left (−) to right (+), **y** is height (1.65 = eye level), and **z** runs towards the entrance (+) or deeper inside (−).
- **`FACE`** sets which way the front of an object points: `FACE.entrance`, `FACE.back`, `FACE.left` or `FACE.right`.
- **Collision is automatic:** walls from `buildWall()` and anything standing on the floor via `place()` block walking. For boxes added directly, call `blockWalking(mesh)`.
- **Brand-coloured materials:** `MAT.accentWall`, `MAT.brandDark`, `MAT.fabricBrand` and `MAT.accentGlow` follow the project's `theme`.
- `projects/starter/environment.js` is the smallest complete example.

---

## Tour content (`tour-data.js`)

Each stop has an `id`, `name`, `description`, `camera: { position, lookAt }`, optional `via` points (the camera passes through them on the way to this stop, for example through doorways), an optional `panorama` (360° photo projects) and a list of `hotspots`.

Each hotspot has an `id`, a `label` (the tooltip), a `position: [x, y, z]` and a `popup`. Every popup field except `title` is optional:

```js
popup: {
  title: 'Reception Desk',                 // header (required)
  subtitle: 'Staffed 8:30 – 18:30',        // small line under the header
  text: ['First paragraph.', 'Second <b>bold</b> paragraph.'],  // string or array
  image: 'assets/images/reception.jpg',    // path inside the project folder, or a full URL
  imageCaption: 'Our front desk',
  layout: 'side',                           // image left, text right
  audio: 'assets/audio/welcome.mp3',
  audioLabel: '🔊 Listen',
  audioAutoplay: false,
  video: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXX', // or 'assets/video/intro.mp4'
}
```

---

## Performance

On a slow laptop, override `graphics` in the project's `settings`:
- `shadows: false` gives the biggest speed-up.
- `maxPixelRatio: 1`.

For 3D models, keep the file small (compressed textures, under ~50 MB).

## Working offline

Download these into a `vendor/` folder and change the two URLs in the `importmap` in `index.html`:
- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.170.0/build/three.module.js`
- the `examples/jsm/` folder of the same version (used: `environments/RoomEnvironment.js`, `utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js`, `loaders/GLTFLoader.js`)

The demo video in the Harbinger `tour-data.js` is also online. Replace it with a local file in the project's `assets/video/`.

---

## Sharing a compressed copy (`dist/`)

`build-dist.mjs` makes a copy of the site in `dist/` with only what the page needs: `index.html` without its comments, minified JavaScript and CSS, and every project's assets. The docs and the git history are left out. Use it to share the tour from your own computer with a temporary link.

### What you need
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** 20 or newer (the LTS version is fine). Check with `node --version`.
- **Python**, to run the copy in step 2 (as in "How to run").
- **An internet connection the first time.** The script downloads a small minifier called esbuild and reuses it afterwards.

### Steps

1. **Build** the copy:
   - In VS Code, open a terminal with **Terminal** → **New Terminal** (Ctrl+\`). It opens in this folder.
   - Run:
     ```
     node build-dist.mjs
     ```
   - After a few seconds it prints:
     ```
     Done: dist/ is ready. Try it with:  python -m http.server 8080 --directory dist
     ```
   - `dist/` now appears in the file explorer, greyed out because git ignores it. Each run deletes the old `dist/` and builds a fresh one.
2. **Run** it:
   ```
   python -m http.server 8080 --directory dist
   ```
   Open http://localhost:8080/ and check the tour works. Keep this terminal running (Ctrl+C stops it).
3. **Share** it from VS Code:
   - Open the **Ports** tab next to **Terminal** (or Ctrl+Shift+P → **Ports: Focus on Ports View**).
   - Click **Forward a Port**, enter `8080` and sign in with GitHub when asked.
   - Right-click the port → **Port Visibility** → **Public**. Otherwise visitors are asked to sign in.
   - Right-click the port → **Copy Local Address** and send that link. Add `?project=starter` to show another project.

### Good to know
- Run `node build-dist.mjs` again after every change (texts, stops, images, colours). `dist/` does not update by itself.
- The link only works while your computer is on and VS Code and the server are running.
- Visitors see a Microsoft "dev tunnel" notice the first time and click **Continue**.
- To stop sharing, right-click the port → **Stop Forwarding Port**, then press Ctrl+C in the terminal.
- Don't share through Live Server: it serves the whole project folder, including `.git`.
- `dist/` is in `.gitignore`, so it is never committed.

### If something goes wrong

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `node is not recognized` | Install Node.js, then close and reopen VS Code. |
| `Cannot find module ...build-dist.mjs` | The terminal is in another folder. `cd` to this folder first. |
| A network or `npx` download error | You are offline, or a network proxy blocks the esbuild download. Try again on another network. |
| `python is not recognized` | Install Python, or use `npx serve dist` and open the address it prints. |
